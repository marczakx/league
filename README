Foosball league backend   (Spring Boot, Hibernate, REST)

The application enables:
- adding teams to the league,
- adding match results,
- displaying the table.

The table contains the number of games played, the number of points, the number of won and lost sets.

A match consists of two or three sets.
If there is a 1-1 draw after two sets, the third set is played.
The first two sets are played to the score 10 and the third set is played to the score 5.

The winning team scores 1 point.

The application creates a table based on the saved results.
The order of the teams is determined based on the points scored. 
In the case of the same number of points, 
higher in the table is team who scored more goals.
